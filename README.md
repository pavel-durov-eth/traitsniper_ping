# 📜 Repository Description 📜

🕰️ Once, in order to participate in a retrodrop, it was necessary to connect twitter, but the site was so busy that it did not want to give the code, and without it, it was impossible to participate in the company. So I wrote a simple script that once every 30 seconds makes a request to the API server traitsniper, and in case of success returns the code.

📝 P.S. The code never helped me 😄
